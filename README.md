RankFrenchWords
===============

A small set of tools to rank the frequency of words used on Le Monde.

I wrote this a few years ago, so the RSS location has probably changed, and I'm not certain if Google Translate still allows scraping it via their ajax URL...

It would probably be more efficient to send the words to BigQuery now, but that didn't exist when I wrote this.
